    # Don't allow (bio)fuels to provide more than a certain percentage of the system's energy
    # Note: when the system really wants to use more biofuel, it is possible to "game" this limit by
    # cycling power through batteries, pumped storage, transmission lines or the hydrogen system to
    # burn off some 
    # extra non-fuel energy, allowing more biofuel into the system. (This doesn't typically happen 
    # with batteries due to high variable costs -- e.g., it has to cycle 4 kWh through a battery to
    # consume 1 kWh of non-biofuel power, to allow 0.05 kWh of additional biofuel into the system. 
    # Even if this can save $0.5/kWh, if battery cycling costs $0.15/kWh, that means $0.60 extra to
    # save $0.025. It also doesn't happen in the hydrogen scenario, since storing intermittent power
    # directly as hydrogen can directly displace biofuel consumption. But it could happen if batteries
    # have low efficiency or low cycling cost, or if transmission losses are significant.)
    # One solution would be to only apply the RPS to the predefined load (not generation), but then
    # transmission and battery losses could be served by fossil fuels.
    # Alternatively: limit fossil fuels to (1-rps) * standard loads 
    # and limit biofuels to (1-bio)*standard loads. This would force renewables to be used for
    # all losses, which is slightly inaccurate.
    # TODO: fix the problem noted above; for now we don't worry too much because there are no
    # transmission losses, the cycling costs for batteries are too high and pumped storage is only
    # adopted on a small scale.
